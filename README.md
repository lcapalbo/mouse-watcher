# mouse-watcher

*mouse-watcher* is a small accessibility tool.

It polls the mouse position to detect big changes/fast movement, and then increases mouse cursor size a little, thus making it easier to find on big screens. Default cursor size is restored after a little while (1 second).

Works on Unity 7 (Ubuntu 16.04) and depends on xinput. It is inspired by a similar function on OS X.

Hackish, but it works :P
